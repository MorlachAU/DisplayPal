# Display Manager

A Windows system tray application that manages display brightness, colour temperature, and refresh rate across switchable profiles. Think of it as a smart display profile manager — set up your preferred screen settings for different activities and switch between them instantly.

Built for anyone who switches between work, coding, and gaming on the same monitor and wants their display to adapt automatically.

---

## Features

### Core
- **Four display profiles** — Work, Code, Game, and Cinema, each with independent settings
- **Multi-monitor support** — Automatically detects and controls all connected displays
- **Brightness control** — Hardware backlight adjustment via DDC/CI (external monitors) and WMI (laptop screens)
- **Colour temperature** — Direct gamma ramp control from 1200K (warm amber) to 6500K (neutral daylight)
- **Refresh rate switching** — Change monitor refresh rate per profile (e.g., 60Hz for work, 100Hz+ for gaming)
- **System tray app** — Minimal footprint, always one click away

### Automation
- **Global hotkeys** — Ctrl+Alt+1/2/3/4 for instant profile switching (configurable)
- **Ambient mode** — Colour temperature gradually shifts throughout the day following the sun's position (warm at night, neutral at noon)
- **Sunrise/sunset auto-switching** — Automatically shifts to a configured profile at sunset and sunrise
- **Time-based scheduling** — Set fixed times to switch profiles (e.g., Work at 8am, Code at 6pm)
- **Monitor wake recovery** — Automatically re-applies your profile when the display wakes from sleep

### Extras
- **Cinema mode** — A dedicated profile for movie watching (30% brightness, 3500K warm, purple tray icon)
- **Panic button** — Ctrl+Alt+P instantly switches to Work mode (for when the boss walks in)
- **Quick Dim** — Ctrl+Alt+D instantly drops brightness to 10% and back
- **Profile Lock** — Ctrl+Alt+L prevents scheduled switches from interrupting your gaming session
- **Disco mode** — Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D for 5 seconds of wild colour cycling (easter egg)
- **Usage stats** — Track hours spent in each profile per day/week with visual bar charts
- **Notification toasts** — Windows notifications on profile switch (toggle-able)
- **Per-profile tray icon colours** — Blue (Work), Amber (Code), Green (Game), Purple (Cinema)
- **Colour-coded lock indicator** — Red dot on the tray icon when profile lock is active
- **IP-based location detection** — One-click setup for sunrise/sunset feature
- **First-run system check** — Verifies DDC/CI, detects conflicts (f.lux), shows available refresh rates
- **Auto-start with Windows** — Toggle in settings, managed via registry

---

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or 11**
- Works on **laptops** (built-in screen via WMI) and **external monitors** (via DDC/CI)
  - For external monitors, DDC/CI must be enabled in the monitor's OSD settings
- **f.lux must be closed** if installed — Display Manager replaces f.lux for colour temperature control

## Usage

### Switching Profiles

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Tray menu** | Right-click the tray icon, click a profile name |
| **Hotkey** | Ctrl+Alt+1 (Work), Ctrl+Alt+2 (Code), Ctrl+Alt+3 (Game), Ctrl+Alt+4 (Cinema) |
| **Schedule** | Automatic — configure in Settings > Schedule |

### Hotkeys

| Hotkey | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Ctrl+Alt+1 | Switch to Work profile |
| Ctrl+Alt+2 | Switch to Code profile |
| Ctrl+Alt+3 | Switch to Game profile |
| Ctrl+Alt+4 | Switch to Cinema profile |
| Ctrl+Alt+D | Quick Dim toggle (10% brightness) |
| Ctrl+Alt+L | Profile Lock toggle |
| Ctrl+Alt+P | Panic button (instant Work mode) |
| Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D | Disco mode (5 second easter egg) |

Profile hotkeys are configurable in Settings > Profiles.

### Settings

Right-click the tray icon and click **Settings** to open the configuration window:

- **Profiles tab** — Adjust brightness, colour temperature, refresh rate, and hotkey for each profile. Use "Revert to Default" to reset a profile.
- **Schedule tab** — Enable sunrise/sunset auto-switching (click "Detect" to set your location automatically) or add fixed time rules.
- **General tab** — Auto-start, notifications, ambient mode, transition speed, hotkey reference, and current status.
- **Stats tab** — Visual bar charts showing time spent in each profile today and this week.

### Profile Lock (Auto-Lock)

When you manually select a profile (tray menu or hotkey), it **automatically locks** to prevent scheduled or ambient switches from overriding your choice. You'll see a red dot on the tray icon confirming the lock.

To return to automatic mode, either:
- Right-click the tray icon and click **Unlock Profile**
- Press **Ctrl+Alt+L**
- Select **Ambient** from the tray menu (auto-unlocks and enables ambient mode)

While locked:
- Scheduled, sunrise/sunset, and ambient switches are all blocked
- Manual switches (hotkey or tray menu) still work
- Lock resets on next app launch

### Ambient Mode

Ambient mode gradually shifts colour temperature throughout the day following the sun's position — warm at night, neutral around noon. It's like f.lux but built in.

Right-click the tray icon and select **Ambient** to enable it (shows a checkmark when active). Ambient appears alongside the profiles in the tray menu, so you can quickly switch between a fixed profile and ambient mode.

Selecting a fixed profile (Work, Code, Game, Cinema) auto-locks and disables ambient adjustments. Selecting Ambient unlocks and lets the automatic colour shifting resume.

## Default Profiles

| Profile | Brightness | Colour Temp | Refresh Rate | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Work** | 80% | 6500K (neutral) | 60 Hz | Documents, dashboards, video calls |
| **Code** | 50% | 5000K (warm) | 60 Hz | Dark theme coding, evening sessions |
| **Game** | 75% | 6500K (neutral) | 100 Hz | Colour accuracy, smooth gameplay |
| **Cinema** | 30% | 3500K (warm) | No change | Movie watching, cosy vibes |

All values are fully customisable per profile.

## How It Works

| Feature | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Brightness | [screen-brightness-control](https://github.com/Crozzers/screen-brightness-control) — DDC/CI for external monitors, WMI for laptops |
| Colour temperature | Win32 `SetDeviceGammaRamp` — same technique f.lux uses internally |
| Refresh rate | Win32 `ChangeDisplaySettingsW` — system-level display mode change |
| Sunrise/sunset | [astral](https://github.com/sffjunkie/astral) library — offline calculation, no internet needed after location is set |
| System tray | [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray) |
| Settings UI | [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) |
| Global hotkeys | [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) |

---

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `config.json` alongside the executable (or `main.py` if running from source). The file is created automatically on first run with sensible defaults. You can edit it directly, but the Settings UI is the intended way to configure everything.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No displays found" or brightness not changing**
- **External monitors:** Check that DDC/CI is enabled in your monitor's OSD settings. Try a different cable — some cheap HDMI cables don't carry DDC/CI signals.
- **Laptops:** Brightness control uses WMI which works on most laptops. If it doesn't work, check your display driver is up to date.

**Colour temperature reverts immediately**
- f.lux is probably running — close it. Both apps write the same gamma ramp and will fight each other.

**Brightness doesn't change**
- Some monitors have a DDC/CI setting buried in a submenu — check your monitor manual
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the display cable

**Tray icon not visible**
- Click the "^" overflow arrow in the Windows taskbar — new tray icons are often hidden there
- Drag the icon out of overflow to pin it to the taskbar

---

## FYI

**Brief screen flash when switching refresh rates** — If your profiles use different refresh rates (e.g., 60Hz for Work, 100Hz for Game), you may see a brief black screen when switching between them. This is normal — Windows performs a full display mode change when the refresh rate changes, which momentarily blanks the screen. Switching between profiles with the same refresh rate (e.g., Work to Code) is instant with no flash.

## Building from Source

To create a standalone executable:

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed --name "DisplayManager" --icon "assets/icon.ico" --add-data "assets;assets" --collect-all customtkinter --hidden-import pystray._win32 main.py
```

The output will be in `dist/DisplayManager/`. Zip the entire folder to distribute.
